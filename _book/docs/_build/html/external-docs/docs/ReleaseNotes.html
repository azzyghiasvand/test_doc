<p>0.7.2 includes stability fixes. We recommend all 0.7.0/0.7.1 users upgrade.</p>
<div class="section" id="bug-fixes">
<span id="bug-fixes"></span><h2>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-fixes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Improved REST server scalability in the presence of long running scan requests.
Previously, long running scans could block out other requests, including the service
health check. This causes DeploymentManager to report the service as unhealthy. This has
been fixed so there are separate request handlers for long requests.</li>
<li>Fix to planner refusing all connections due to race conditions when logging. Specific
request patterns to CDAS can get the planner in a state where it refuses all subsequent
connections. This causes the services to report as 5/7 healthy as well as the REST
server going into a restart loop. This is caused by race conditions resulting in logs
not being drained properly. This has been resolved by upgrading our bundled docker version
(to 1.12.6) as well as log handling improvements.</li>
<li>Fixed deployment in environments which require HTTP proxy configurations. Some of
the new validations added in 0.7 were not properly using HTTP proxy configurations in all
cases, causing those calls to fail. No configuration changes are required. We now
properly use the proxy configurations if set.</li>
<li>Fixed deployment when the cluster’s private IP range conflicts with what CDAS
requires. Specifically, in 0.7.2, we resolved the conflict on the IP range <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10.32.0.0/12</span></code>.</li>
<li>Fixed token expiration display for Json Web Tokens (JWT) in the UI. The value displayed
in the previous version was incorrect and much longer than the actual expiration. Note
that this was a presentation issue only; the tokens would have expired correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where catalog does not load properly when there are invalid catalog objects.
These catalog objects are unreadable by Cerebro but now this no longer causes other
catalog objects to be skipped.</li>
<li>Support LDAP default domains and SSL enabled servers. Previously, CDAS only supported
distinguished names. Now it is possible to login with a domain name, for example
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USERS\user</span></code>. It is also possible to configure a default domain and just login with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">user</span></code>.</li>

<div class="section" id="new-features">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#new-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>JSON structured audit logs</strong></p>
<p>By default, the planner audit log is now output as json in the planner logs. The new
format contains more information, is much easier to parse and will be stable over time.
For more information on its schema and how to use it, see the <a class="reference external" href="Auditing.md">docs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Support for Hive SerDes</strong></p>
<p>Prior versions of CDAS had limited support for tables which require a custom Hive SerDe
to read. In this release, we extended the support to all the CDAS supported types, the
ability to read SerDe libraries from S3 and builtin, HiveQL compatible support in the
various CDAS <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hive-ddl</span></code> APIs. For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="ExtendingCDAS.md">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Support for external views</strong></p>
<p>In prior version of CDAS, views created in Cerebro had to be evaluated in CDAS. This is
critical for views which enforce data security related transformations. For example, if
the view anonymizes user data, the view must be evaluated in CDAS before it is returned
to the client. In this release, we added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">external</span> <span class="pre">views</span></code>, which are used
to store views to store data transformations and have no security implications. These
views are used strictly for tracking what can be evaluated in CDAS or in the compute
application.
For more details, see <a class="reference external" href="SupportedSQL.md">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Support to drop permissions when dropping catalog objects</strong></p>
<p>Dropping a database, table or view does not drop the permissions on the object. This
means if the same object with the same name is created, it will retain the permissions
from the dropped object. This pattern is sometimes used, for example in ETL, where
the permissions and catalog object (re)creation are decoupled. This behavior is not
ideal in other cases. In this release we extended the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DROP</span> <span class="pre">[DATABASE|TABLE|VIEW]</span></code>
DDL commands to support optionally dropping the associated permissions as well. If not
specified, this command is backwards compatible and keeps the previous semantics.
For more information see <a class="reference external" href="SupportedSQL.md">this</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic REST API scan page size</strong></p>
<p>Previously the REST scan page size was fixed (by default 10000 records). This can be
problematic for tables with very many columns and requests would cause timeouts or
other bad behavior. In this release, the page size is dynamic (up to 10000 by default)
and adjusts based on how long the requests are taking.</p>
<p><strong>Improved client connection related errors</strong></p>
<p>Previously, the errors related to failed connections from the Java client libraries
required looking at the CDAS service logs. These errors should now be returned to
the client. Note that this requires updating the client library to the latest version
(beta-9) as well. Older clients are compatible and will continue to work, but may not
see the improved error reporting in all cases.</p>
<p><strong>Filtered dataset search in the UI</strong></p>
<p>The Cerebro UI now has enhanced dataset search capabilities, allowing users to search
for datasets by name and/or database name, as well as filter by any set of databases.</p>
<p><strong>Dataset access inspection in the UI</strong></p>
<p>Dataset stewards (or anyone with all access to a dataset) can inspect which groups or set
of groups has access to their datasets as well as which fields in those datasets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bug-fixes">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-fixes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed an issue where the 30-second timeout for session_ids issued
by the /api/scanpage endpoint was starting from the beginning of a query,
resulting in the user being “charged” for system time. This was corrected
and the timer now starts when CDAS begins returning data to the user.</li>
<li>Fixed /api/scanpage endpoint so that for fetching more than 10,000 records, the total number of
records to be fetched only needs to be specified on the first call. Subsequent calls can use the
session_id to return the remaining records in batches of up to 10,000 entries. If the record number
is specified in subsequent calls, it will be ignored.</li>
<li>Unable to see a database if the user has only been granted access to that database’s
columns. This issue has been resolved and the user can properly see a database even if
they only have partial access to objects in the database.</li>
<li>Allow dropping views even if its metadata becomes invalid. In previous versions, it
would sometimes not be possible to drop views if its metadata became invalid. This can
happen for example, if the base table for the views are deleted. These views can now
be dropped.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where permission granted to a top-level S3 bucket was not being
propagated to sub-directories.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue were detailed error messages were not being returned to clients for
server-side errors (they were being overwritten with generic error messages).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Hive in EMR 5.8 and later would not work with CDAS.
EMR 5.8.0 upgraded Hive from 2.1.1 to 2.3.0 which introduced a backward compatibility
breaking api change, which has been addressed.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="incompatible-and-breaking-changes">
<span id="incompatible-and-breaking-changes"></span><h3>Incompatible and Breaking Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#incompatible-and-breaking-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The records parameter for the /api/scanpage REST endpoint now indicates
the total number of records that the query should return. This had
previously indicated the batch size to be used for each page. Results are
now returned in batches of up to 10,000 entries.</li>
<li>Number of services in standalone cluster reduced from 8 to 7. In the release, the
earlier version of the UI was completely removed, reducing the number of services by 1.
In 0.6.x, this service was running but not externally exposed by default (for example,
even in 0.6.x, endpoints did not report the earlier UI).</li>
<li>Root user required to run kubectl commands on kubernetes master.
Previously, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kubectl</span></code> could be run as any user, for example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ec2-user</span></code>. It is now required
to be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">root</span></code> to run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kubectl</span></code>.</li>
<li>Existing launch scripts will not work with 0.7.0. We have enhanced our validation of
launch scripts when they are registered during the cerebro_cli “environments create”
call. The changes required to perform that validation necessitates that all launch scripts
must to be replaced with ones based on the new template provided in the 0.7.0 release.
Launch scripts based on earlier templates will cause the “environments create” call
to fail. All of the values that need to be configured have been moved to a dedicated section
towards the top of the script in the new template, so porting older launch files should
be fairly quick. Launch scripts based on the 0.7.0 template are backwards compatible with
older CDAS releases.</li>

gmail account.</p>
<p><strong>Improved SSL support</strong></p>
<p>Some clients (e.g. latest version of chrome) require the REST server to have a DNS
domain name (instead of IP) if SSL is enabled as additional security. In this release, we
added a configuration to specify the DNS name for the REST server. This is not required
for SSL to be enabled and not all clients require the server to be configured this way.</p>
<p>This configuration is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CEREBRO_SSL_FQDN</span></code>. For example:</p>

<p><strong>New Web UI</strong></p>
<p>The Web UI has been revamped with a new look-and-feel, enhanced stability, and
several new features, including improvements to dataset discoverability, metadata, and
account information.</p>
<p>Datasets are now searchable from the dataset browser; search for datasets by name.</p>
<p>Dataset information has been expanded. We now explicitly display which columns the
current user has access to and which groups grant access to those columns without
access. We also show which columns are partitioning columns. Finally, a description
of how to integrate a dataset with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R</span></code> has been added.</p>
<p>On the home page, account details are displayed, including the token for the current
user, which groups the current user belongs to, the roles the current user has,
and the groups granting those roles.</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="WebUI.md">docs</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Significantly improved integration with EMR</strong></p>
<p>EMR integration has been significantly improved, allowing better pushdown into CDAS
across the engines, improved multi-tenant user experience, work scheduling, etc. See
<a class="reference external" href="EMRIntegration.md">EMR docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Support for SSL</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deprecating specifying user token as part of URL for REST server</strong></p>
<p>We will be deprecating supporting specifying user tokens as part of the URL in a
subsequent release and recommend users start switching now when using the REST server.
For example, instead of querying <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rest-server-host:port/api/databases?user=&lt;TOKEN&gt;</span></code>,
clients should instead specify the token as part of the Authorization header. See these
<a class="reference external" href="Authentication.md">docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>WebUI port renamed</strong></p>
<p>The name of the webui port has been renamed from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cerebro_catalog_ui:webui</span></code> to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cerebro_web:webui</span></code>. This value is used when configuring ports
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CEREBRO_PORT_CONFIGURATION</span></code>) as well as the output from listing the service endpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Permission roles are now consistently case insensitive</strong></p>
<p>Case sensitivity in roles was inconsistent and now we’ve made them consistently case
insensitive. This means that commands such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CREATE</span> <span class="pre">ROLE</span> <span class="pre">admin_role</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CREATE</span> <span class="pre">ROLE</span> <span class="pre">ADMIN_ROLE</span></code> now are identical.</p>

<p><strong>Dataset preview in Web UI or Catalog REST API shows 0s instead of NULLs</strong></p>
<p>When navigating to a particular dataset in the Web UI and clicking “Show Preview”,
if the value of a particular cell is NULL, it is displayed as 0. This issue
additionally exists when querying the Catalog REST API at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/api/scanpage/&lt;dataset&gt;</span></code>.</p>
<p>The workaround to determine the correct value of the cell is to query the dataset
records via alternate Cerebro clients, like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dbcli</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Unable to upgrade an existing cluster from 0.5 to 0.6</strong></p>
<p>The install binary format has changed in 0.6, meaning clusters prior to 0.6 will not
be able to handle the binary images. Note that the metadata stored in a 0.5 cluster <em>can</em>
be read by a 0.6 cluster. Users can create a new 0.6 cluster instead. If upgrading an
existing cluster is important, contact us and we can manually do this.</p>
<p><strong>Unable to see databases if user has only been granted columns to objects in database</strong></p>
<p>If a user has been granted only partial access to all objects (table or views)
in a database, they are not able to see the database or any of the contents in it. Users
are only able to properly see the objects if they’ve been granted full access to at
least one table or view in that database (at which point the access controls work as
expected).</p>
<p>Workaround: create a dummy table in these database and grant users full select on this
table.</p>
<p><strong>Hive in EMR does not support all DDL commands</strong></p>
<p>The Hive Cerebro integration for EMR does not currently support all DDL commands. It
does not support GRANT/REVOKE statement and ALTER TABLE statements.</p>
<p>Workaround: use the DbCli or connect through a kerberized Hive installation.</p>

<p><strong>JSON Web Token and SSO support</strong></p>
<p>This release adds support for authentication with CDAS using JSON Web Tokens(JWT).
These tokens can verified by CDAS using either public/private keys or via an
external SSO server. This can be used in addition to or instead of kerberos
authentication. If an external SSO server is configured, Cerebro can also be
configured to generated SSO tokens in our webui.</p>
<p><strong>Support for joins with views</strong></p>
<p>Support has been added to create views which contain joins. Previously, views only
support filters and projections. This enables use cases where the sensitive data
needs to be joined against a (dynamic) whitelist. After creating the view, the
identical grant/revoke statements can be used to control access to it. The kind
of joins we enable is limited, see <a class="reference external" href="SupportedSQL.md">docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Improved support for EMR, including Hive and Presto</strong></p>
<p>While previous versions could support EMR, we’ve improved the integration experience,
providing a bootstrap action which enables deeper integration. See the
<a class="reference external" href="EMRIntegration.md">EMR Integration docs</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified Install Process</strong></p>
<p>DeploymentManager config verification has been improved significantly to catch
more configuration issues as well as report the issues more intuitively. Please
let us know how to improve this further. We’ve also removed the steps to upload
any config files to S3 manually as part of the install.</p>
<p><strong>Hadoop client updates</strong></p>
<p>This release corresponds to the beta-6 release of the Hadoop client libraries. While
previous clients are API compatible, we advise upgrading to this version.</p>

</ul>
<p>This will need to be updated in the CEREBRO_PORT_CONFIGURATION value as well as the
output of ‘cerebro_cli clusters list.’</p>
<p><strong>Java client token authentication change</strong></p>
<p>Previously, Hadoop java clients (e.g. MapReduce, Spark, Pig, etc) needed to specify
the service name if they were using token authentication. This service name had to
match the principal of the cerebro cluster. For example, if the Cerebro cluster had
the kerberos principal ‘cdas/service&#64;REALM’, the service name had to be ‘cdas’. This
value could change from CDAS cluster to CDAS cluster which can be difficult.</p>
<p>In 0.5.0, we’ve update it so this value should always be ‘cerebro’ and we recommend
that clients not set it at all (it is the default in the updated client jars). Clients
that were setting it will see connection failures.</p>
<p>For example, in spark, applications should remove specifying:
‘spark.recordservice.delegation-token.service-name’.</p>
<p><strong>Environment variable name change</strong></p>
<p>The environment variable CEREBRO_JWT_SERVICE_TOKEN_FILE has been replaced with
CEREBRO_SYSTEM_TOKEN. Users upgrading from 0.4.5 will need to update this config.</p>

<p><strong>Unable to see databases if user has only been granted columns to objects in database</strong></p>
<p>If a user has been granted only partial access to all objects (table or views)
in a database, they are not able to see the database or any of the contents in it. Users
are only able to properly see the objects if they’ve been granted full access to at
least one table or view in that database (at which point the access controls work as

<p><strong>Cluster Administration</strong></p>
<p>Cluster administration has been significantly enhanced to protect your cluster from
accidental termination, scaling an existing cluster, and upgrading to newer versions
of CDAS components.
See <a class="reference external" href="ClusterAdmin.md">Cluster Administration</a> for further details.</p>
<p><strong>SQL Statement Processing</strong></p>
<p>The Record Service daemon and catalog-admin rest endpoint scan and scanpage APIs now
process SQL statements through a POST interface.</p>
<p><strong>Database Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong></p>
<p>End-user database and dataset functionality is made available through a command line (CLI)
tool, dbcli.  The tool enables users to acquire tokens, list databases, list datasets in
a database, show the schema for a dataset (describe), view a sample of data, create tables
and grant permissions through Hive DDL.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="DbCLI.md">Database CLI</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Authentication using LDAP</strong></p>
<p>With this release, Basic authentication using LDAP is introduced, which should
allow Cerebro users to authenticate using their Active Directory credentials.</p>
<p>The user now has an option to either use the REST API or the new
web-based login UI to get their Cerebro token using their Active Directory
username and password.</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="LdapAuthentication.md">LDAP Basic Auth Document</a> for details.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cerebro_cli</span> <span class="pre">agents</span> <span class="pre">state</span></code><ul>

<li>Sets the version to be used by clusters that are subsequently created.
The version flag sets the version of CDAS to install and the
components flag allows for specific components to run a different, likely higher,
version of that component. This command wipes out any existing version and
component settings. The –version argument must be a valid version,
–components is also required but can be an empty string.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AWS Region Configuration</strong></p>
<p>Deployment Manager will now detect the AWS region that it is running in if one is not
configured via the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION value. The result is cached, requiring a
Deployment Manager restart (following a change in your configuration) if you want to
manage a cluster in another AWS region.</p>
<p><strong>Kerberos</strong></p>
<p>DeploymentManager allows a kerberos principal for the REST API to be explicitly specified.
Previously this was assumed to be derived from the service principal
(i.e. HTTP/&lt;service_host&gt;).
See <a class="reference external" href="KerberosClusterSetup.md">Kerberos</a> docs for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment Manager</strong></p>
<p>The S3_STAGING_DIR environment variable is now validated during Deployment Manager
startup.
Improved reporting of issues that arise during agent startup.
Configured service port uniqueness is now enforced during Deployment Manager startup.</p>
<p><strong>Using Encrypted S3 buckets</strong></p>
<p>Writes to S3 buckets now set the server-side encryption flag on the S3 write or copy
request if the S3_STAGING_ENCRYPTION configuration is set to true.</p>

<p><strong>Change to CEREBRO_KERBEROS_KEYTAB_FILE config</strong></p>
<p>Previously, this config used to be the basename of the keytab file and the user was
required to upload the file to Cerebro’s S3 staging directory. In this release, this
config has been updated to be the full path to the keytab. The path can be on the
DeploymentManager machine (e.g. /etc/keytabs/cerebro.keytab) or on S3. No steps are
now required to upload the keytab to the staging directory.</p>
<p>The prior config will no longer validate and the DeploymentManager will not
start up. Users coming from a previous release will need to update their configs.
For example, by changing:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">export</span> <span class="n">CEREBRO_KERBEROS_KEYTAB_FILE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">cerebro</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">keytab</span>

</div>
<p><strong>Rename database to db</strong></p>
<p>Some REST APIs used the field name ‘database’ and others used the field name ‘db’.
All APIs were changed to consistently use the term ‘db’  This impacts the following APIs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>api/datasets [POST]</li>
<li>api/datasets/{name} [POST]</li>

file.</p>
<p><strong>Unable to delete a launching cluster</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, it is not possible to immediately terminate a cluster that is launching

<p><strong>CLI interface for catalog</strong></p>
<p>The REST API was intended for programmatic access. While it is possible to use it
interactively (using curl), it is not very user friendly. We have added a CLI that
sits on top of the REST API. It provides identical capabilities to going against the
REST API directly.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions API</strong></p>
<p>We added a permissions API to both the REST API and CLI which can be useful to examine
the aggregate result of the policies that have been set. It is useful to answer
questions such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What datasets (and pieces of them) does this particular user/group have?</li>
<li>What are all the users/groups that have access to this dataset?</li>

<p><strong>Policy API has changed</strong>.</p>
<p>The endpoints are different (/api/grant-policy, /api/revoke-policy). The arguments are
largely the same. It is no longer necessary to delete policies and not possible to view
them.</p>

<p><strong>Creating the dataset with ‘storage_url’ currently requires the dataset to be parquet.</strong></p>
<p>The workaround is to specify the request using hiveql.</p>
<p><strong>Granting a policy with filters is disabled</strong></p>
<p>This causes compatibility issues with clients such as Impala. The workaround is to register
the dataset with the filter and grant the policy on the new dataset.</p>
